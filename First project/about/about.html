    <div class="about">
      <p>
        There are all kinds of dogs - brave, clever, good hounters, sniffers..
        But we choose the gentle companion dogs - Pugs! We are in dog breeding
        since 2010s and we have dedicated our lives to improving breed,
        following FCI standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        We look after our animals like our own children. We, more than anyone,
        understand that while anatomy, hair, smooth body proportions and good
        teeth are all important, it is also important that the dog has a
        well-rounded personality. For this reason we can confidently say that
        when you buy a puppy from "Unreal beauty" you will receive a suitable
        and well-socialized partner who will live with you for years to come.
        From an early age, all our puppies interact with children, cats, and
        other dogs of all sizes, so they develop an extremely stable personality
        and they are incredibly friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our dogs are constantly involved in various shows, from the local to the
        regional World and European championships, and our main goal is... to
        win them! We have important bloodlines and genes for our puppies,
        because it is a guarantee that they will be proper and healthy
        representative of the breed.
      </p>
      The price of our animals varies according to their level. We can supply
      puppies which demonstrate promise as elite show animals and we can also
      supply puppies as pets to be wonderful companions and make a house a home.
      Most importantly of all, however, is the fact that all our puppies are
      outstanding representatives of their breed and are absolutely healthy and
      sound in every way as all the kids (yes, that's right, the puppies are our
      children), without exception, are under the close supervision of the best
      veterinarians and are fed on a time-tested diet of the best food.
